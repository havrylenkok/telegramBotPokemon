  \t/nearpoke <location> - returns info about ALREADY SPAWNED pokemon on specified by you location.
  \t/mayspawn <location> - returns info about pokemon that MAY SPAWN on specified by you location.
  
  If you send your LOCATION to bot it will return list of ALREADY SPAWNED pokemon for your coordinates.
  
  Note that work in progress and for now bot looks for small radius from specified by you location, so don't expect it to scan nearby streets. 
  It scans only what you inserted.`,
